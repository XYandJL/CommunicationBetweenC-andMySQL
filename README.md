## Any additional installations required to run the program:
* Operating system: Windows 11
* Compilation environment: Visual Studio 2022
* Database: MySQL5.7
* Browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.

## A summary of the program
The program designed this time is implemented in C++ language, which realizes the communication between C language and MySQL;
The addition, deletion, modification and query of tables in MySQL database can be realized through C++ language;
The data of the table is saved to a local txt file;
HTML+JavaScript can be executed through C++; and HTML and JavaScript files can be responded to through the browser.

## Any known bugs
There are no known bugs

## Future work
In the follow-up, the front-end page display of the system can be realized in HTML language;
And the direct interaction with the front-end and the database can be realized through C++ language.

## The grade you think you have earned
* Design (self-evaluation---23 points)
    * After careful consideration and examination, the system was designed and modified, and the management of MySQL database tables was realized, including adding, deleting, modifying, querying, browsing, etc., and realizing the operation of HTML and JavaScript files through C++ language.
* Execution (self-evaluation---46 points)
    * Completed communication with MySQL database and HTML and JavaScript, the program has no errors, and the data is saved, and the code style is good
      good code style
    * a. The code can be understood from the text, and the command method is implemented according to the ventilation. Small camel case: method name, variable name, parameter name, all uppercase: constant name, underscore between words, use tab indentation, and spaces must be added to the left and right sides of the operator , there must be one and only one space between the comment double slash and the comment content. When method parameters are defined and passed in, a space must be added after the commas of multiple parameters;
    * b. No spaces should appear between the left and right parentheses and the content of the parentheses
      A single method does not exceed 80 lines, and a single line does not exceed 120 characters
      Control statements must use curly braces
      There cannot be assignments in conditional expressions
      Multiple levels of nesting cannot exceed three levels
      avoid negation operator
    * c. Notes
      Condensed comments
      Modify the comments while modifying the code
      Annotation for enums is required
      method annotation /**/
      use in method //
* Usability (self-evaluation---23 points)
    * The usability is good, the user interaction interface is good, the user selects the corresponding function to execute the corresponding code through the function that he needs to implement, the output is clear and easy to read, the program is clear, useful and interesting.
